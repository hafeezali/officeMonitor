- And individually commit thier aggregate work on a file,like `README.md : blah blah blah`
- Word the commits in abstract, and present tense.
- And the along with @rahul-kumi review one other collaborator's review is needed for the PRs to be merged.
- the reviews and the suggestions happen in hte comment section of the PRs, when a reviewer suggests edits its expected of
